# 07 - More on components: Nested Component

*Start from step-06 branch (Awaiting demo ðŸš€)

**â„¹ We'll work on the created component `starComponent` which display the rating with stars**

1. Use this component as a Nested Component into your `product-list.component.html` to replace the `{{ product.starRating }}`
2. Create an `@Input` property called `rating` into the `starComponent`
3. Update the `StarComponent` template to display 5 stars and listen click on them to `console.log` the clicked value.
4. Create an `@Output` property called `ratingClicked` into the `starComponent` which will return the new value of the rating.
5. Listen the created `ratingClicked` event into the `ProductListComponent` to update the value into the component.
