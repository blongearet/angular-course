## 08 - Services and dependency injection

*Start from [step-07 branch](https://github.com/blongearet/angular-course-app/tree/step-07)*

1. Create a service and a class

    1. Create a new angular service called `ProductService` in the following path `shared/model/product`
    2. Create a new class called `Product` in the same folder

2. Feed the `Product` class by moving the existing Product interface into this Class file.
3. Feed the `ProductService` by moving the collection used into the `ProductListComponent`.
4. Write a public `getProducts` method to access to this products array
5. Consume this methods into the `ProductListComponent`
